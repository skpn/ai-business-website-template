SPEAK FRENCH WHEN TALKED TO IN FRENCH !

## URLs (update these for your client)
- Repository: https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME
- Staging site: https://staging.example.com
- Production site: https://example.com
- GitHub Actions: https://github.com/USERNAME/REPO_NAME/actions

## Workflow
- staging = preview site
- main = production site

## Rules
- Never push directly to main
- Always commit to staging
- Global UI lives in src/components
- Do not add frameworks or build tools

## Helping Non-Technical Users
When assisting with git or deployment:
- Provide exact, copy-pastable terminal commands
- Explain what each command does in plain French
- After commits/pushes, provide the direct GitHub Actions link to check build status
- If a build fails, explain the error simply and provide steps to fix
- Always include relevant direct links (to PRs, branches, Actions runs)
- Confirm which branch we're on before suggesting push commands
